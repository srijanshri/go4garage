This web page had been created as an assignment for company named Go4Garage.
I was given a mobile view of the entire thing and told to come up with a web view of the same and I could use my own creativity with it.
I did try on few animation. For detailed view please follow the link https://srijanshri.github.io/go4garage/
The following screenshots can help you get the gist of the page.
